# MIPSS_32Pipelined-Processor
The implementation of 32-bit MIPS ISA was done using Verliog HDL. This design has 5 stage stage pipelining.
The processor was synthesised on Design Compiler using NanGate 15nm library with following operating condition.

    Operating Condition Name : typical
    Library : NanGate_15nm_OCL
    Process :   Typical
    Temperature :  25.00
    Voltage :   0.80
    Interconnect Model : balanced_tree
